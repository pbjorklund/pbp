# Project Analysis and Documentation TODOs

## Initial Project Understanding
- [ ] Explore repository structure using LS and Read tools to understand codebase organization
- [ ] Read existing README.md to understand current project description and identify gaps
- [ ] Identify main directories and their purposes (src/, docs/, config/, etc.)
- [ ] Check for package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, or other dependency files to understand tech stack
- [ ] Look for build/deployment scripts to understand project workflow

## Technology Stack Analysis
- [ ] Identify primary programming languages used (via file extensions and directory structure)
- [ ] Determine frameworks, libraries, and tools from dependency files
- [ ] Check for configuration files that indicate specific technologies (docker-compose.yml, CI/CD configs, etc.)
- [ ] Identify build systems, test frameworks, and development tools
- [ ] Note any special requirements or environment dependencies

## Project Purpose and Scope
- [ ] Determine if this is: application, library, tooling, configuration, documentation, or mixed
- [ ] Identify target audience: developers, end-users, system administrators, etc.
- [ ] Understand deployment model: CLI tool, web app, desktop app, system service, etc.
- [ ] Check for any domain-specific terminology or business logic

## Documentation Quality Assessment
- [ ] Evaluate README.md completeness: installation, usage, examples, contribution guidelines
- [ ] Check for inline code documentation and comments
- [ ] Identify missing sections that would help new contributors or users
- [ ] Look for outdated information that needs updating

## Development Workflow Analysis
- [ ] Check for CI/CD configuration (.github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml, etc.)
- [ ] Identify testing strategy and test file locations
- [ ] Look for development scripts (package.json scripts, Makefile targets, etc.)
- [ ] Check for linting, formatting, and code quality tools

## Project-Specific Instructions Template
