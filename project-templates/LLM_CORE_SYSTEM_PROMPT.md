# Project Context Template

Replace this template with project-specific information that actually matters:

## What This Project Does
[One sentence. Skip the marketing speak.]

## Architecture That Matters
- **Data flow**: [How data moves through the system - the non-obvious parts]
- **Critical dependencies**: [The ones that break or have version constraints]
- **Performance bottlenecks**: [Where things get slow and why]
- **Security boundaries**: [What handles auth, secrets, external access]

## Development Reality
- **Local setup gotchas**: [What breaks during setup and how to fix it]
- **Testing that works**: [What tests actually run and matter, ignore the rest]
- **Build quirks**: [Non-standard build steps, environment dependencies]
- **Debug workflow**: [How to actually debug issues in this codebase]

## Quick Reference
- **Run locally**: [Actual commands that work]
- **Deploy**: [Real deployment process, not theoretical]
- **Common tasks**: [The 3-5 things you do most often]
- **Emergency fixes**: [How to quickly fix common breakages]

## Project-Specific Rules
- **Code patterns**: [Established patterns used here, not generic best practices]
- **File organization**: [Where different types of code live and why]
- **Configuration**: [Where configs live, how to change them safely]
- **Third-party integrations**: [APIs, services, tools this depends on]

## Things That Break
- **Known issues**: [Recurring problems and their solutions]
- **Deployment traps**: [What goes wrong during deploys]
- **Environment differences**: [How dev/staging/prod actually differ]
- **Monitoring blind spots**: [What isn't logged or monitored well]

## Domain Knowledge
[Business rules, domain concepts, or technical context that isn't obvious from the code]

**Instructions for AI assistants:**
- Assume basic development competency
- Focus on this project's specific quirks and patterns
- When in doubt about approach, check existing similar code first
- Test changes against the actual testing workflow described above
- Ask about project-specific decisions before making architectural changes
